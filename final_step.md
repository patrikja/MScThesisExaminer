After the final presentation, please act on the comments from the
opponents (and others) and prepare the final version of the thesis.
After it has been OK:ed by the supervisor please send it to the
examiner (me) for a final read and comment cycle. When you have the OK
from me on the report it is time to report the result to LADOK.

Three things are needed for the LADOK reporting:
* R = the final pdf of the report
* W = the work-card(s) with all signatures from others filled in
* F = the form ["Records of grading"](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/MasterThesis/Filer/Records_of_grading-i.pdf)

Please fill in your part of F and hand in F + W on paper and R by
email to the examiner.
