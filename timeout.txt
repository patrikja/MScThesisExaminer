[Rules changed in 2016 - now 30 weeks + possible 10 week extension.
Old text below.]

(Final clarification for those with an extension from 9 to 12 months.)

Please note that the hard deadline at 12 months is approaching
(examiner was assigned YYYY-MM-DD).  If you are not done with your
thesis within a year the thesis grade is reported as Fail. You may
then restart your thesis work with a new assignment of supervisor +
examiner. (In that case I would not be examiner because I have other
teaching in 2017.)  Depending on the new examiner and perhaps new
supervisor you may be allowed to reuse parts or all of the previous
work done but formally it is a fresh start (new proposal, etc.). The
deadlines for proposals are listed here:

This mail is just a warning - you can still present and hand-in the
final thesis report but do note that it is getting really close.
