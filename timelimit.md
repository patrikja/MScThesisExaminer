Warning mail after almost 30 weeks:

I hear you need to cancel your presentation date. Then we need to be a
bit careful with the formalities: I may need to make a formal decision
to either extend the time or to report the thesis failed. The
background is this:

  https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/masters-thesis/Documents/Instructions_for_Theses_2016.pdf

  ยง9.1.1: "... the student shall have been approved on all components as above totalling 30 working weeks. The examiner may, if there are exceptional reasons, extend this time limit by 10 working weeks at a time."

The formal starting date (when I was assigned as examiner) was
YYYY-MM-DD and 30 weeks after that was a few weeks ago (YYYY-MM-DD +
30 weeks).

If you know already that (YYYY-MM-DD + 30 weeks) won't work I need
(within a week) a written request to extend from 30 to 40 weeks with a
good (but short) plan showing why that would be enough (when the
previous plan has failed). Otherwise (the default) I need you to book
a presentation slot a week or so before the 30-week mark.
