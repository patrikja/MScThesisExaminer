# AI Policy for Bachelor’s/Master’s Thesis Projects

## Introduction

Generative AI (or simply AI) refers to tools that use probabilistic models and machine-learning techniques to generate new content based on large amounts of previously published material. Examples of modern generative AI tools include ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft). Many software applications and search engines now integrate AI by default, sometimes without you actively choosing to use it.

The use of generative AI is neither required nor prohibited in this course. However, there are rules regarding **how** it may be used. Different types of AI use fall into three categories: “permitted”, “problematic”, and “prohibited”. This policy is intended to help you make well-informed decisions about AI use in your thesis work. While the main focus is on academic writing, the same principles apply to source code developed during the project.

Regardless of how AI is used, the fundamental rule remains:
**As authors, you are responsible for ensuring that all content in your report is accurate, verified, and follows good academic practice.**

## Permitted, Problematic, and Prohibited Uses

AI tools are powerful, but they also come with risks. Beyond concerns about environmental impact, privacy, and bias, AI systems may generate content that is incorrect or fabricated. Because such output often **appears convincing**, errors can be difficult to detect—especially if you are new to the subject.

A general recommendation is therefore to **avoid using generative AI to complete tasks that you do not already have the knowledge and skills to judge or perform yourself**. The three categories of AI use are described below.

### 🟢 Permitted Use

It is permitted to use AI as linguistic support, for example to:

* check grammar
* suggest synonyms
* propose alternative phrasings

as long as the purpose is to help you express your *own* ideas more clearly.

> Example: “How can I rephrase this sentence to make it sound more natural?”

Using AI to translate short phrases is also allowed.

> Example: “Translate this phrase into English: det gick inte.”

### 🟠 Problematic Use

Relying heavily on AI to generate large portions of text can become problematic when it no longer supports your own learning and writing. Think of it this way: **Writing is an intellectual process. If writing suddenly feels too easy because of AI, you are likely relying on it too much.**

> Example: “Write a paragraph introducing the client–server model.”

### 🔴 Prohibited Use

AI-generated content can never be treated as complete or reliable without your own critical review. This is especially true for academic claims and references. You must **never** assume that an AI-generated reference exists or is appropriate in context.

Presenting AI-generated “facts” or references as correct without verifying them yourself creates a risk of unintentionally including false or fabricated material in your report. This violates good academic practice.

> Example: “Find a suitable reference for this paragraph.”

It is also prohibited to use AI to write substantial portions of the report (or entire chapters) for you. This is considered a breach of academic integrity and may be treated as a form of plagiarism.

> Example: “Write my thesis report.”

## Contribution Report (individual account of work contributions and AI use)

When submitting the thesis, the group must also submit a supplementary document: the *Contribution Report*. This document describes each student’s individual contributions and is used as a basis for the individual assessment.

The Contribution Report is compiled by the group but consists of **individual sections** (approximately one page per student), where each group member describes in their own words:

1. **Work Contribution and Responsibilities**

   * project roles and areas of responsibility
   * specific tasks completed by the student
   * which parts of the codebase and report (chapters/sections) the student was responsible for

2. **Declaration of AI Use**

   * a description of how generative AI was used in the work
   * classification of the usage according to this policy (permitted, problematic, or prohibited)
   * if no AI tools were used, this must be stated explicitly

All individual sections are combined into **one joint PDF document**, submitted together with the final thesis report.
