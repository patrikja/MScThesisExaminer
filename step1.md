Good to hear I'm the examiner for your MSc thesis project. Most of the
interaction will be between you and your supervisor.  (I don't need to
be part of the regular meetings.) The next "formal step" involving me
is for you (supported by your supervisor) to hand in a "planning
report" [1] (based on the thesis proposal) *within ten days* and for
me to "grade" that (Pass or Fail).

I'm collecting my instructions (and some relevant links) here

Kind regards,
  Patrik

PS. Don't take the "planning report" too seriously - it is not
supposed to take a lot of time to write. The contents in basically a
somewhat extend version of the "thesis proposal" + time plan.
