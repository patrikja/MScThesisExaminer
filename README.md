# MScThesisExaminer

Some documents related to my role as examiner (for the Programming Languages area) of MSc theses at the CSE department, Chalmers and GU.

* [Grading guidelines for project proposals](grade_project_proposal.md)
* Planning report (due 10 days after the project proposal has been accepted)
    * The planning report can be seen as an extended version of the project proposal extended with a time plan.
    * The start date is around or before the hand-in of the project proposal (writing the proposal is also part of the MSc thesis work)
    * Make sure to include a preliminary date for the mid-term report/presentation.
* [Mid-term report/presentation](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/content/planning-and-mid-project-reports)
    * When the planning report has been accepted, the next next step is to plan a concrete meeting slot for the half-time reporting. I suggest using a doodle to find a suitable date and time.
    * Send me the draft report the day before the meeting. (Your supervisor should have read the draft before I get it as examiner.)
    * The meeting should include a short (informal) presentation of the state of the MSc thesis work.
    * There should also be time for discussing possible updates to the time plan. (A need to update the plan at this stage is the norm rather than the exception.)
    * Optional: If you'd like the "status report" presentation to be seen by others than the examiner and supervisor then please arrange for booking a room + announcing it in the CSE Weekly News. But note that a half-time public presentation is _not_ a requirement for the MSc thesis course. It could be a way to get feedback from interested researchers (and to be "seen" by potential PhD position recruiters at the department).
    * Optional: Similarly, the mid-term meeting could take place at an external site if the MSc thesis is done at a company.
