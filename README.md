# MScThesisExaminer

Some documents related to my earlier (mainly 2016) role as examiner (for the Programming Languages area) of MSc theses at the CSE department, Chalmers and GU.

* [Find a project proposal](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/program-proposals): Look through the list and contact the suggested supervisor.
    * I have some [proposals I could supervise](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/supervisor/patrik-jansson)
    * but I could also be examiner of many other related proposals within [Functional Programming](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/proposal-keywords/functional-programming), [Type Theory](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/proposal-keywords/type-theory) and [neighbouring topics](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/proposal-keywords).
* My [grading guidelines for project proposals](grade_project_proposal.md)
* [Planning report](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/232) (due 10 days after the project proposal has been accepted)
    * The planning report can be seen as an extended version of the project proposal extended with a time plan.
    * The formal start date is when the project proposal is accepted (but writing the proposal is also an important preparation for the MSc thesis work)
    * Make sure to include a preliminary date for the half-time report/presentation.
* [Half-time report/presentation](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/content/halftime-report)
    * When the planning report has been accepted, the next next step is to plan a concrete meeting slot for the half-time reporting. I suggest using a [doodle](http://doodle.com/) to find a suitable date and time.
    * Send me the draft report the day before the meeting. (Your supervisor should have read the draft before I get it as examiner.)
    * The meeting should include a short (informal) presentation of the state of the MSc thesis work.
    * There should also be time for discussing possible updates to the time plan. (A need to update the plan at this stage is the norm rather than the exception.)
    * Optional: If you'd like the "status report" presentation to be seen by others than the examiner and supervisor then please arrange for booking a room + announcing it in the CSE Weekly News. But note that a half-time public presentation is _not_ a requirement for the MSc thesis course. It could be a way to get feedback from interested researchers (and to be "seen" by potential PhD position recruiters at the department).
    * Optional: Similarly, the half-time meeting could take place at an external site if the MSc thesis is done at a company.
* [Final report](https://masterthesis.cms.chalmers.se/content/final-thesis-report): some notes for CSE-department theses
    * (often forgotten) "Cover Page: Your report should have a common frontpage where both Chalmers and University of Gothenburg are stated, regardless of which university you are studying at."
    * Please include an "Acknowledgements" page or similar so that it is clear who was supervisor, who was examiner and who else contributed. Examples: [1](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/219016/219016.pdf), [2](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/225866/225866.pdf), [3](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/225931/225931.pdf), [4](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/235325/235325.pdf)
    * Make sure to proof-read the thesis carefully and iterate it with your supervisor until it is well polished. Only then send it to the examiner.

* [Final warning about time out](timeout.txt)
