# Grading a MSc thesis project proposal
(Patrik Jansson)

* Goal 1:
    * at least list a few _MSc-level_ courses to build from
    * these have to be within "the main field of study" or "focus of the study programme"
    * also cite relevant litterature

* Goal 2:
    * Use methods from the main field of study

* Goal 3:
    * Aim at contributing to research and development work (in a research group or at a company, etc.)

* Goal 4
    * The problem description should be clear (and the problem complex)

* Goal 5:
    * (Plan and use adequate methods - mainly for the planning report.)

* Goals 6-11:
    * Mainly at later stages
